# CONTAINER MONITORING

This should be used once the `./automateSetup.sh` is done, then you come on to run this on the RSYSLOG SERVER.

While running this, the thing is, you have to add the IP address along with Port *(and before doing this, ensure, you have gone thru the container metrics, where the command for setting the `node-exporter` is done on the Device-aka computer or your LXC)* of all the devices you wish to monitor-that is, make a **SEPARATE Job Name** for that.
